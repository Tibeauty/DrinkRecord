# My Personal Project

## Task 1

- **What will the application do?**  
  The application will allow users to track their daily water and beverage intake. It will compare the amounts of water and other drinks consumed. If the user meets the recommended daily water intake, the app will provide positive feedback. However, if the user consumes too many beverages instead of water, the app will issue a warning, encouraging them to drink more water.

- **Who will use it?**  
  People who want to monitor and improve their hydration habits, particularly those who may not drink enough water and tend to rely on sugary or other types of beverages.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**  
  Many people today prefer drinking flavored beverages over water, mistakenly thinking that these drinks can quench their thirst just as well. However, this habit can have serious health consequences, including the risk of kidney disease. I have at one point before caused physical discomfort from drinking too many drinks. This project is important to me because I want to promote healthy hydration habits and raise awareness of the dangers of not drinking enough water. The app can also help not only myself, but also other people to stay hydrated by providing them with useful insights into their drinking habits.
