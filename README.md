# My Personal Project

## Introduction

I am developing an application that will allow users to track their daily water and beverage intake. The app will compare the amount of water consumed with other drinks, offering **positive feedback** when users meet the recommended daily water intake. However, if the user consumes too many beverages instead of water, the app will provide a **warning**, which encourage poeple to get healthier hydration habits. This project is aimed at people who want to monitor and improve their hydration, particularly those who tend to rely on sugary or flavored drinks. Iâ€™ve personally experienced the negative effects of consuming too many drinks, which led to physical discomfort. This has inspired me to build this app to promote healthier hydration and provide users with valuable insights into their drinking habits, helping them make better choices to stay healthy.
